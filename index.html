              <li>Your teachers and administrators have secure, private access to SIS records and IEPs 24 hours a day.</li>
              <li>Access is available from any Internet connection.</li>
              <li>Information is shared among all those with authorized access to it and only needs to be entered once. The system eliminates duplication of effort.</li>
              <li>You can set up a curriculum organized by subject and grade level for your whole school and make it available to your teachers for assessing student performance.</li>
              <li>Your teachers can document class activities and student progress against standards in the normal course of their classroom duties.</li>
              <li>Information prepared by your teachers online in the normal course of their class day can be reused for accreditation or other reporting purposes.</li>
              <li>Teachers can create (and administrators can review) IEPs using their own custom libraries of frequently used PLOP and Goal Statement patterns. These statements from the library can contain "variables" like "Nickname" to automatically personalize the statement when placed in a specific IEP. They can be edited further for individual students.</li>
              <li>A historical record of outcomes is automatically created.</li>
              <li>Data is stored in a secure, offsite location.</li>
              <li>Compliance is improved.</li>
              <li>Since the system is all online, there is no hardware to buy and maintain, and no software to purchase or install. In fact there are no hardware and software start-up costs!</li>

            <p>What did you do in school today?'

'Nothing.'

Sound familiar?

Not anymore!

Welcome to iNTELLISHARE, where we give you secure online access to your child's classroom experience.

Using Class Logs, teachers can document each day's activities. What did we talk about? What are the most important points to remember? What was most interesting? What is the assignment for tomorrow? If it's appropriate, for example in a kindergarten environment, they can even include pictures of the children that have been taken in the classroom. In short, they can include whatever they want that will help communicate to parents what their children are engaged in at school.

Parents can view this information over any Internet connection using secure, password-protected access.</p>

If someone can use email, they certainly have the computer skills they need to use iNTELLISHARE. And the savings of time are obvious. So, in general, there is very little pushback from staff.

Having said that, nobody's perfect. So we consistently invest time identifying and working with people who are having trouble using the system. This process gives us insights about how to further simplify the system, and to make it even more intuitive.</p>
